<h2>Problem 7</h2>
<p>
By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.
<br>

<h2>Problem 6</h2>
<p>
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
<br>
1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385<br>
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
<br>
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 552 = 3025<br>
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640.
<br>
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

<h2>Problem 2</h2>
<p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
<br>
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
<br>
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
